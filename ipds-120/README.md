This directory contains my clone of the ipds-120 multimodule adapter for the
ipds-100. This will allow you to use, for example, isbx-251 bubble memory
modules. See https://www.smbaker.com/adding-bubble-memory-to-an-ipds-100-personal-development-system-clonding-the-ipds-120-multimodule-adapter
for more information.

See the schematic for important notes, especially concerning U16 (and U18) and the
memory wait circuitry that gave me some issues when I implemented it using HCT
logic.

See my blog post on the website for more info.
